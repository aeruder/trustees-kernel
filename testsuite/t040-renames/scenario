# Format:
# should_(pass|fail) user operation [argument1 argument2 ...]
# See the README for the operations.

# First lets create some files
should_pass bill write /file1
should_pass bill write /file2
should_pass bill write /file3

# Files in same directory should rename (covered by same trustee)
should_pass bill rename /file1 /file1.rename

# And even in /tmp (covered by same trustee)
should_pass bill rename /file2 /tmp/file2.rename

# But across trustees, that is a nono :(
should_fail bill rename /file3 /etc/file3.rename
should_fail bill rename /file3 /dev/file3.rename

# Now here this should fail into /var (covered by a DW)
# but should pass on /var/log (still covered by same trustee as /)
should_fail bill rename /file3 /var/file3.rename
should_pass bill rename /file3 /var/log/file3.rename

June 10, 2007:
    Bumped for kernel 2.6.21, this is now required for trustees.   In the
    future, multiple stable kernel revisions will be supported.

    trusteesfs was removed in favor of securityfs which is already
    in the kernel.  You should mount -t securityfs none /sys/kernel/security
    upon boot.  In the future, most security modules should be using
    this interface.  It is no longer necessary to unmount this to remove
    the trustees module and it can be mounted prior to loading trustees.
